# Churn_problem
we try to predict if the customer will churn or not in a telecom company

#Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom industry using various machine learning techniques. The following preprocessing steps and techniques have been applied to the dataset to prepare it for model training and evaluation.

#Steps Taken

#Outlier Handling:
Identified and removed or corrected outliers in the dataset to ensure that they don't skew the model's performance.

#Duplicate Handling:
Removed any duplicate records in the dataset to avoid redundant data and improve the integrity of the analysis.

#Missing Value Treatment:
Handled missing values using appropriate techniques (e.g., imputation, removal) to ensure a complete dataset for analysis.

#Feature Selection:
Identified and selected the most important features using feature importance techniques to enhance model accuracy and reduce overfitting.

#Train-Test Split:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data.

#Scaling Features:
Applied MinMaxScaler to normalize the features, ensuring that each feature contributes equally to the modelâ€™s learning process.

#Dimensionality Reduction using PCA:
Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dataset to the top 10 most significant components, improving the computational efficiency and reducing noise.

#Imbalanced Data Handling:
Addressed the issue of class imbalance in the dataset using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or synthetic data generation (e.g., SMOTE).

#Model Validation:
Used cross-validation techniques on different models to evaluate performance and select the best model for churn prediction.
